## GUI tools

- [Svgartista](https://svgartista.net/) - SVG Artista is a tool that helps you animate stroke and fill properties in your SVG images with plain CSS code.

- [Cssanimate](http://cssanimate.com/) - Welcome to CssAnimate.com, tool for easy and fast creating CSS3 keyframes animation, right in your browser without using any desktop software. If you want to render complex and consistent CSS3 animation on your site this tool is made for you! You can create complex CSS3 keyframe animation without any coding and to get ready made css styles for using on your site.
- [Ceaser](https://matthewlein.com/tools/ceaser) - Now that we can use CSS transitions in all the modern browsers, let's make them pretty. I love the classic Penner equations with Flash and jQuery, so I included most of those. If you're anything like me*, you probably thought this about the default easing options: “ease-in, ease-out etc.” The mysterious cubic-bezier has a lot of potential, but was cumbersome to use. Until now. Also, touch-device friendly!
- [Cubic Bezier](https://cubic-bezier.com/) - A great utility for creating Bezier curves. You can import and export curves to/from your library to share them with others.

Timeline has 101 keyframes ( 0% to 100%) direction from left to right. Highlighted keyframe indicate that some style is assigned to that point. You can add new style at selected point.

## Books

- [SVG animation](https://www.amazon.com/SVG-Animations-Implementations-Responsive-Animation/dp/1491939702)

<p>
 <img src="data/covers/92ZiDgAAQBAJ.jpg" align="left" width="400"/>
 SVG is extremely powerful, with its reduced HTTP requests and crispness on any display. It becomes increasingly more interesting as you explore its capabilities for responsive animation and performance boons. When you animate SVG, you must be aware of normal image traits like composition, color, implementation, and optimization. But when you animate, it increases the complexity of each of these factors exponentially.
